I'm felix_red_panda, [I write mostly on X](https://x.com/felix_red_panda) but also in long form on here occasionally

I currently work as AI Research Engineer at Prime Intellect

I love tinkering/training neural speech synthesis and large lanugage models

(fun fact: this last edit was made by my custom code LLM that directly generates outputs git diffs)

If you want to get in touch, please send me a direct message on X to @felix_red_panda
